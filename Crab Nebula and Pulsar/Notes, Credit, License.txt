# Notes:
Animated here is a real-life Crab pulse-train taken with Westerbork, as it appears to originate from the pulsar in the center of the Nebula.

The sound is a partly-running-averaged and re-modulated Westerbork detection of the Crab Pulsar.

Source files are the After Effects scenes, and sound and image files.
